## Notes

Due to time constraints, a few features weren't able to come to fruition. These features include categorizing recipes by levels of 
difficulty, and the ability to enter a list of ingredients and have recipes recommended to the user based off the ingredients
entered. A page for text entry was created, but was left out of the final application as it had no use other than providing an error
message when an ingredient was entered. On the final application, the homepage offers a clickable photo that cycles through photos
of meals that the app offers ingredients for.
